      <h2 id="contract">Independent Software Consultant</h2>
      <p>
        With over 11 years of experience in the software engineering field, I
        have developed skills in various technologies including JavaScript,
        Python, Ruby and cloud infrastructure (GCP, AWS, Azure). My expertise
        has allowed me to work on numerous projects that have contributed to the
        growth of the organizations I have worked for.
      </p>

      <p>
        More recently, I have gotten into people management, which has enabled
        me to cultivate my leadership and communication skills. I've discovered
        my enthusiasm for driving successful outcomes, motivating teams, and
        fostering collaborative work environments. My work on my own startup
        projects has been the ultimate test of these skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a contract CTO, Engineering Manager, and Software Developer, I have
        had the opportunity to work on diverse projects with a variety of
        different clients. My approach has always been simple: listen to the
        client's needs and requirements, work collaboratively with the team, and
        ensure delivery of a high-quality product that exceeds the client's
        expectations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, my passion for software engineering and my experience in the
        field have allowed me to establish myself as a dependable and skilled
        professional for hire.
      </p>

      <h2 id="rockdoc">Entrepreneur</h2>
      <p>
        My most recent project was <a href="https://rockdoc.se">RockDoc</a>,
        software to simplify construction project management. It is a vertical
        software solution for facilitating communication between office and
        site, tracking work and understanding the true state of a project in
        real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        As technical cofounder of RockDoc, I started by working on the code that
        RockDoc runs on along with the cloud infrastructure behind it. Running a
        startup requires a wide variety of skills. Over time, my focus shifted
        to managing our team of contract developers, planning and designing and
        improving our team's processes.
      </p>

      <h2 id="dataviz">Accomplished Data Visualization Designer</h2>
      <p>
        In parallel with my software development career, I have delved deep into
        the domain of data visualization. I spent a period of my career focused
        heavily on data visualization artistic design as well as the technical
        implementation of complex data graphics.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have received various recognition for my data visualization work,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>received multiple grants</li>
        <li>won a prize</li>
        <li>
          had my work published in various publications - I one time designed
          visualizations for Ben Bernanke! (<a
            href="https://tylernwolf.com/contact"
            >more info here</a
          >)
        </li>
        <li>spoke on panels and at conferences and</li>
        <li>ran workshops about dataviz</li>
        <li>taught multiple dataviz courses</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I have found time and again throughout my career that data visualization
        design is an uncommon and very useful skill. It is especially useful
        when working with data-centric applications, but tends to pop up in
        unexpected places. My skill in this area has proven to be a valuable
        asset, enhancing my breadth of experience as a software developer and
        enabling me to provide added value to clients.

      <h2 id="product-design">Former Product Designer</h2>
      <p>
        Early on in my career, I had the opportunity to work full-time as a
        Product/UX Designer, albeit briefly. While I eventually returned to my
        true calling in software development, that experience provided me with a
        wealth of knowledge about the bigger picture of building a software
        product.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a software developer, my foray into design taught me to consider the
        various elements that go into designing a product and to prioritize a
        user-centric approach. This deeper understanding has significantly
        improved my collaboration with designers because we speak the same
        language and can work more effectively together.
      </p>

      <p>
        My expanded perspective has also enhanced my leadership skills, giving
        me a comprehensive understanding of how different disciplines perceive
        project priorities and how the various pieces of a software project fit
        together. Communication is central to effective leadership and this
        understanding enables a deeper level of communication.
      </p>

      <h2 id="public-speaking">Public Speaker</h2>
      <p>
        I have spoken publicly about building software products, data
        visualization design, working with open data and freelancing as a
        software developer. I took a break from public speaking during the Covid
        pandemic, but plan to pick up again in the medium-term.
      </p>

      <h2 id="teaching">Teacher</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy the work that I do and I enjoy teaching it to others even more.
        In addition to several workshops, I have taught two formal modules on
        data visualization design at Hyper Island, a digital skills trade school
        with locations worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teaching a subject challenges me to test and enhance my own
        understanding of the topic. Explaining concepts in a clear and effective
        way leads to a deeper appreciation of the intricacies of the subject
        matter. I have also found that putting complex concepts into words often
        leads to new insights and a deeper understanding of the subject for both
        myself and my students. A great experience!
